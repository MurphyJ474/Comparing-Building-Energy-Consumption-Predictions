In this project, we estimate the heating and cooling energy requirements of buildings using both simple physics-based
principles and machine learning models using the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset. We hypothesize that if modeled correctly
the machine learning model should be able to predict the heating and cooling requirements of the buildings with greater
accuracy than physics principles due to the restraints of the available data.
